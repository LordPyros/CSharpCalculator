# CSharpCalculator

After finding problems/errors with the Windows 10 Calculator (Eg. 2 / 5 % = 0.1??????) I decided to build my own, plus I like maths and thought it would be a good excercise.

This calculator was not designed to support order of operations.

I intend to pretty up the UI at some point, its plain and ugly.
